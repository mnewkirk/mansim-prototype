# mansim-prototype
a management simulation prototype: better productivity and output through better management principles
## Why?
I found that setting up all of the pieces and tuning was made more difficult through other forms of documentation, but this was easy and allowed me to pipe prototypical actions through some faux simulation rules to see what expected outputs might be.
## What's to come?
Probably more rules, tuning, and evaluation of outputs.
